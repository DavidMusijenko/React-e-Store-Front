## Toolkit requirements

When selecting a toolkit for this assignment, following these guidelines is mandatory.

## Required:

- React. Anything not written in React will be rejected automatically.
- Class components.
- Create-react-app to scaffold the application.

## Allowed:

- State management libraries (e.g. Redux, Recoil)
- CSS-in-JS approach allowers (e.g. styled-components)

## Prohibited:

- UI libraries (e.g. Tailwind, Material UI, Ant Design)
- Functional components, due to the reasons described above.

## Functionality requirements

- PLP - product listing page, a.k.a. category page
- PDP - product description page, a.k.a. product page
- Cart page + Cart overlay (minicart)

## Details

See some more specific information on the main requirements below. Remember - if something is in the design, but is not explicitly described here or above, it should be implemented anyways.

- Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart - on the cart page itself, PLP and PDP should be provided.
- For products that have various options (attributes) - the options should be selected.
- The selected options of added to cart products should be visible in cart overlay and in cart page.
- If an attribute is a swatch attribute (type = swatch), a representation of the value should be rendered on PDP and PLP, rather than text description (e.g. the color itself, not "Blue" or "0000FF")
- Filtering products by category name for all of the categories from BE
- The descriptions provided in HTML format should be parsed and presented as HTML, not as plain text
- Ability to change the currency of the store to one of the available currencies
